Collection of tools to work with the File System.

The marketplace has a number of great extensions to work with files and folder, I installed a few of them to cover the entire range of actions I normally use, unfortunately that means there is some overlapping between them, basically the same action is contributed by multiple extensions. That is what motivated me to build this extension: I like the idea to have a single extension for all those operations and without duplicates; plus, it is a good pastime ðŸ˜Š.

Please open an issue to leave a comment, report a bug, request a feature etc... (you know the drill).

## Workspace Trust

The extension does not require any special permission, therefore is enabled to run in an [Untrusted Workspace](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/120251).

## Current list of commands

* Copy file name
* Copy file name without extension
* Copy file name with line number or range (e.g. `file.txt:2~8` for a selection from line 2 through 8)
  * Supports multiple selections
  * Multiple ranges are separated by `;`
* Copy full file path
* Copy full file path with line number or range (e.g. `C:\temp\file.txt:2~8` for a selection from line 2 through 8)
  * Supports multiple selections
  * Multiple ranges are separated by `;`
* Copy containing folder full path
* Copy relative file path
* Copy relative file path with line number
* Copy workspace folder path
* Convert path string to posix format
* Convert path string to win32 format
* Copy text selection with file metadata (line numbers, file path, selection range)
